## Technical Implementation

### Backend Requirements
The following API endpoints need to be implemented on the backend:

```http
POST /api/admin/verify-company
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: [JWT_TOKEN]

{
  "companyId": 123
}
```

```http
POST /api/admin/unverify-company
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: [JWT_TOKEN]

{
  "companyId": 123
}
```

```http
POST /api/admin/verify-education-institution
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: [JWT_TOKEN]

{
  "institutionId": 123
}
```

```http
POST /api/admin/unverify-education-institution
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: [JWT_TOKEN]

{
  "institutionId": 123
}
```

### Database Schema Updates
Both `companies` and `education_institutions` tables need:
```sql
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN isVerified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE education_institutions ADD COLUMN isVerified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

## Usage Examples

### Adding Verification Badge to Any Company Display
```dart
import 'package:solid_cv/Views/components/VerificationBadge.dart';

// Inline badge next to company name
Row(
  children: [
    Text(company.name),
    VerificationBadgeInline(
      isVerified: company.isVerified ?? false,
      entityName: company.name,
    ),
  ],
)

// Standalone badge with label
VerificationBadge(
  isVerified: company.isVerified ?? false,
  showLabel: true,
  entityType: 'company',
)
```

### Adding Verification Badge to Education Institution Display
```dart
// Inline badge next to institution name
Row(
  children: [
    Text(institution.name),
    VerificationBadgeInline(
      isVerified: institution.isVerified ?? false,
      entityName: institution.name,
    ),
  ],
)
```

### Checking Verification Status
```dart
// In any widget displaying companies or institutions
final isCompanyVerified = company.isVerified ?? false;
final isInstitutionVerified = institution.isVerified ?? false;

if (isCompanyVerified || isInstitutionVerified) {
  // Show verified UI elements
}
```

## Security Considerations
- Only users with admin privileges can access verification controls
- All verification actions require JWT authentication
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental status changes
- Audit trail recommended for verification status changes

## Future Enhancements
1. **Bulk Verification**: Select multiple organizations for batch verification
2. **Verification History**: Track who verified/unverified and when
3. **Verification Requirements**: Checklist of requirements before verification
4. **Auto-Verification**: Rules-based automatic verification for certain criteria
5. **Verification Levels**: Bronze/Silver/Gold verification tiers
6. **Notification System**: Alert admins when new organizations need verification
7. **Verification Analytics**: Dashboard showing verification statistics
